# File-System-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive report detailing the process and findings of a disk acquisition and analysis project, focusing specifically on a FAT 16 file system. The project was conducted as part of a digital forensics coursework, aiming to demonstrate practical skills in handling, analyzing, and understanding digital storage media.

# Skills and Technologies Used
- Disk Imaging: Utilizing FTK Imager to create a physical image of a USB flash drive.  
- Hex Analysis: Examining the binary content of the disk image using a hex editor.  
- File System Investigation: Exploring FAT 16 file system structures, including the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), File Allocation Tables (FATs), and directory entries.  
- Data Recovery: Techniques for extracting and verifying file contents from allocated and unallocated spaces.  
- Tools: FTK Imager, Sleuth Kit tools (mmls, fsstat, fls, icat), and various hex editors.  

# Objectives
- To understand and apply the principles of digital forensics disk acquisition.  
- To analyze and interpret the structure of a FAT 16 file system.  
- To extract and validate data from a digital forensics image.  
- To demonstrate proficiency in using digital forensics tools and techniques.
